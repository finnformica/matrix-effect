# matrix-effect

This project takes a high contrast image and uses the matrix screen effect to build-up this image using the falling characters. This was then saved to a .mp4 file before loading into a digital photo frame. Another project to improve my javascript skills as I have felt this has been holding me back the most within web development.

To run the project, npm install the dependencies and then - canvas-sketch matrix-animate.js. To learn more about canvas sketch visit https://github.com/mattdesl/canvas-sketch/blob/HEAD/docs/README.md
